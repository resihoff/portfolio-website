          Real-ime advice from real people. PlantPeople is a mobile app that connects users with plant experts for tips and advice. It doesn’t matter if you’re an experienced hobby gardener or just brought home your first houseplant, we all need help
          sometimes. PlantPeople allows users to find experts on a number of gardening and houseplant topics and schedule virtual consultations with them. From one-time advice to longer term guidance, the platform is designed to be welcoming to plant
          lovers of all levels of experience.

          Research
        </h3>
        <p>
          The discovery phase of my project included competitor analysis of 3 apps, a user survey, 5 user interviews, and the creation of 3 user personas.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Competitor Analysis
        </h4>
        <p>
          Out of the myriad gardening apps out there, I chose to focus on 3 that connect users with experts or other users: Smart Plant Home, Garden Tags, and PictureThis.
        </p>
        <p>
          All 3 also include a plant care scheduling tool and educational resources like tips articles, plant encyclopedias, and even, in the case of PictureThis, an AI diagnostic tool.

        <h4>
          User Survey
        </h4>
        <p>
          After getting a sense of the existing market, I needed to get to know potential users and their pain points to fully understand the problem space. A survey allowed me to get a broad view of who engages in gardening as a hobby and in what
          capacity, as well as what tools and resources they currently use.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>24 respondents.</li>
          <li>Primarily aged 18-34.</li>
          <li>Half expressed interest in a gardening expert app.</li>
          <li>None of the respondents said connecting with fellow gardeners was important to them.</li>
          <li>70% have indoor potted plants.</li>
          <li>75% grow plants outdoors.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="sidebar">

          <p>
            Age did not appear to be a major predictor of anything. However, a subsequent survey might add to these findings. I’d like to survey respondents over 50 to see if age would be more of a predictor among this group. I’d also like to make
            the age ranges more granular to see if this yields different findings. I also just want more respondents: 24 was not enough, but I was short on time.

        <h4>
          User Interviews
        </h4>
        <p>
          While the survey gave me a general sense of people’s habits around gardening and keeping houseplants, user interviews allowed me to dig deeper into the day-to-day lives of hobbyists at a all levels from beginners to advanced gardeners. They
          shared their joys and frustrations with their hobby and the resources currently available online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Affinity mapping of 5 interviews revealed a few patterns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's a struggle to find reliable online resources.</li>
          <li>Plant owners take a great deal of pride in their plants.</li>
          <li>The IKEA effect is at play in growing your own food.</li>
          <li>While gardening is a solo activity, many have a family member or close friend with whom they bond over the activity.</li>
        </ul>

          User Personas
        </h4>
        <p>
          After wrapping up my initial research, I crafted 3 user personas to encompass the varied experiences of the potential users I gathered insights from.
        </p>
        <p>
          The personas range from total beginners to experienced gardeners and include both houseplant enthusiasts and those with outdoor vegetable gardens. They include Anita, the busy mom, Yvonne, the beginner, and Sam, the plant parent.

          User Flows
        </h4>
        <p>
          Once I had a decent understanding of my target users’ wants, needs, and goals, it was time to move from discovery to concepting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Lucidchart, I crafted user flows for the core features of the MVP: Chatting with an expert, booking a consultation with an expert, and paying an expert for their time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the time to create user flows allowed me to visualize users’ experiences completing tasks in apps. The flows were invaluable to figuring out what screens I needed to design for the app’s core features.
        </p>

            Taking time to create more complex flows might have helped me in the prototyping phase to develop more thought-out designs and avoid some of the errors uncovered during user testing. More on those errors below.

        <h4>
          Card Sorting
        </h4>
        <p>
          To refine my planned information architecture, I conducted an open card sort using OptimalSort in which participants sorted 20 cards into categories of their own creation. The Explore category came directly from the findings of this
          exercise.
        </p>

            Challenge
          </h5>
          <p>
            Given more time, I would have conducted moderated in-person sessions for insight into why participants chose to categorize content as they did. I suspect some cards were harder to categorize than others and I would have liked some
            insights into participants’ struggles and thought processes.
          </p>
        </div><!-- End sidebar -->
        <p>
          The sitemap changed after I began prototyping (more on that later!). Conducting in-person card sorting and having a few more participants (I had 5) might have generated an information architecture closer to how the app is currently
          organized.

          Wireframe

        <p>
          Sketching low-fidelity wireframes was massively useful in refining my ideas. The onboarding process in particular took several sketches and subsequent iterations to refine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking my sketches into a mid-fidelity prototype using Balsamiq allowed me to focus on the big picture before zeroing in on the details as I created a clickable prototype in Adobe XD.

            Challenge
          </h5>
          <p>
            As I began sketching wireframes, I realized that my information architecture needed to be rearranged a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Smart Plant Home has a hamburger menu in the top left corner, a settings menu in the top right corner, and a sticky navigation bar at the bottom of the screen containing 5 categories, I did not want my app to have that many places
            for users to have to hunt through to find what they're looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to do more usability testing focused on the information architecture of PlantPeople to validate that the settings menu and its contents are intuitive.

          Design

        <p>
          I tested a mid-fidelity prototype to catch issues early on and save time on building out a design that might not be usable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I conducted an initial round of 6 moderated remote usability tests on the Adobe XD prototype. My participants gave me invaluable feedback and insights. I prioritized 5 issues identified by multiple participants:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Difference between "message" and "consult" unclear: I added a stage to the progressive oboarding that appears the first time users navigate to an expert's profile. I described the two features more clearly on the intro screens.</li>
          <li>Pricing and other details of services unclear: I revised the flow for scheduling a consultation to put pricing and other details at the beginning.</li>
          <li>No photo attachment feature in consult scheduling flow: I added this feature.</li>
          <li>Layout of search page confusing: I visually divided the page with a subheading.</li>
          <li>Copy too lengthy on expert profile: I broke up the paragraphs into a bulleted list and shortened the content.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="sidebar">

            One of my testers contracted COVID-19 and was unable to participate on short notice (she has made a full recovery).
          </p>
          <p>
            I was able to substitute her a day later with an edge case of a potential user in her mid-50s. Testing the prototype with someone who said at the end, “I don’t usually do that [use mobile apps] but I knew what to do,” validated the
            usability of the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge: All my participants identified as female and white. In future usability testing, I will seek out more diverse testers to see how usable they find the app.

        </p>
        <p>
          This led me to further changes, particularly in choosing a color scheme with higher contrast for improved accessibility of the overall design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing the design with peers for feedback also led me to make a number of further updates and improvements, including changes to the UX writing.

          Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because gardening and keeping houseplants increased in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, I think there's room in the market for PlantPeople.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to be competitive in the vast market of gardening and plant care apps, PlantPeople needs some added functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MVP covers 3 core features, so the next prototyping and testing phase will focus on builidng out the Explore section where users will find resources such as advice articles and video tutorials. I will also build and teset the Plants
          section where users will be able to add their own plants and create custom care schedules as this is a fairly standard feature of these types of apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my next project, I plan to make accessibility more of a focus from the start, rather than an ad hoc step after finishing most of the design work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had I been more focused on accessibility from the start, I would have chosen a high contrast color scheme to begin with. I was so focused on making the flows simple that I missed that key aspect of usability: A readable button.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gardenign and keeping houseplants are hobbies that know no age boundaries, and while I believe I have built an app that people of all ages can find joy in using, I can't wait to work on the next iteration.
