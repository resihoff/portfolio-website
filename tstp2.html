<h6>Context</h6>
<p>The founder of The Serious Type originally hired Tech Fleet to build a mobile app for her nonprofit that was intended to be a new kind of social network for adolescents. After a first attempt at a mobile app in Phase 1, in Phase 2 we decided to instead replace the original TST website with a progressive web app.</p>

      <h2>Are We Solving the Right Problem?</h2>
      <p>I joined this project in Phase 2 as a UX Research Apprentice. The Phase 1 team's recommendations for Phase 2:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue usability testing of mobile app prototype</li>
        <li>Conduct exploratory research on mentorship as a feature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After reviewing the prototype and the research conducted by Phase 1, our team was excited about the overall vision but skeptical about the details. Mentorship was a big sticking point from the start and one we eventually ruled as outside of our scope. The target user age group had changed from 13-22 to all ages as a result of research findings in Phase 1. That shift didn’t feel right. We needed to get to know users better.</p>
        <p>
The Google Analytics of the original TST website indicated that most users visited the site specifically to share their own content but did not spend time on the site after that. They would take about 5 minutes to submit their post and then leave. At the end of our first week and into the second week, we had several questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What criteria defines our target user group? Are the 13-22-year-olds, or are they older?</li>
  <li>Are our target users interested in a mobile app?</li>
  <li>Is mentorship an unment need of our target users? What might mentorship look like between users in the 13-22 age range?</li>
  </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Pivot from Mobile App to Progressive Web App</h2>
    <p>We conducted a heuristic analysis and audit of the original site and found it lacking in some key functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inconsistent and confusing navigation</li>
      <li>No onboarding or help section</li>
      <li>A nonfunctional "Forum" feature</li>
      <li>No error prevention for when a user navigates away from an unsaved submission</li>
      <li>The "submint" button was buried in a drop-down menu</li>
      <li>No prompt or confirmation before submitting a post</li>
      <li>No clear way to save and access drafts</li>
      <li>Unclear error messages throughout submission form</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What's more, the design didn't allow users to comment on each other's posts or otherwise interact with each other, a standard feature of social media.</p>
      <p>
The Phase 1 mobile prototype was a wholly new platform, but after assessing the team’s research and the existing site, our team decided it wasn’t solving the right problem. We felt that user research with the current users of the site would get us closer to the mark. More on the challenges we faced with that research later.</p>
<p>
A progressive web app would allow ust o meet our client’s expectation for users to be able to download a shortcut to the platform on their home screens, while also replacing the existing site with an upgraded platform that would ultimately better serve her users.</p>

      <p>To better understand our client’s vision, we needed to assess the competition. In Phase 1, they had examined social media platforms, but we branched out into slightly different territory. That first competitor analysis showed us features to avoid, like infinite scroll and algorithm-driven echo chambers. But because we were planning on building a new kind of social network, we needed to examine other types of platforms and pull the best ideas from where every we found them.</p>
      <p>The biggest edge that we felt our platform would have on the competition was its focus on teens. The value proposition of TST would be to help users aged 13-22 to enact social change and make the world a better place by connecting them with a community of like-minded creatives.</p>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>We initially planned to conduct interviews with current TST users to understand what upgrades to make to the platform. However, we ran into difficulties with recruiting willing participants, even after offering incentives and tapping into the client’s network. We moved on with user surveys so we could form insights with the time remaining on the project.</p>
      <h3>Pivot to User Survey</h3>
      <p>Rather than give up on research with current users, we repurposed a portion of our interview script into a user survey. We shared this survey with current users, but also with the general population. As far as we can tell, no current TST users completed the survey, but we did get data from the age group we were most curious about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>22 respondents total</li>
        <li>11 tennage respondents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
Among our teen respondents, we got confirmation that our client’s idea for a kinder, more constructive social network is desirable. We learned teens like the ease of communicating and connecting with friends on existing social platforms. However, they dislike:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The advertisements present on these platforms</li>
  <li>The addictive nature of these platforms</li>
  <li>The negativity they perceive from other users on these platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
In general, the survey results showed we were on the right track. We asked specific questions about sharing creative work online. Users’ reasons for sharing and the type of content they like to share fell right in line with our client’s vision.</p>

<h3>Understanding the User</h3>
<p>I participated in a journey mapping exercise with two of our designers where we built on the proto personas created in Phase 1. We mapped the experiences of 3 different proto personas using the existing website to better understand how that site was failing users and identify areas of improvement. We were able through the journey maps to pinpoint the mismatches between users’ goals and needs and the features available on the existing site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our client moderated content on the site by reviewing each submission for approval before publishing, an unusual pattern for social media users accustomed to immediate results.</li>
  <li>When users are unable to interact with each other or the content on the site, they will quickly lose interest.</li>
  <li>When users can't see the reactions of their audience, the value of posting on the site comes into question.</li>
  </ul>

      </picture>
      <p>But even our final list of MVP features proved too lengthy to tackle in 8 weeks. Features in bold are those we actually designed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in</li>
        <li>Account creation</li>
        <li>Onboarding</li>
        <li>Settings</li>
        <li>Code of conduct/guildelines for users and content (this was a high-effort feature that would have required close collaboration with our client, who had limited availability)</li>
        <li>Landing page for users without an account</li>
        <li>Help and error recovery and error messages</li>
        <li><bold>Clear navigation</bold></li>
        <li>About us page</li>
        <li><bold>Explore page</bold> (not tested as it wasn't finished in time)</li>
        <li><bold>Posts in video, audio, image, and text formats</bold> (our prototype included the buttons for adding all media types, but the tested user flow focused on image uploads)</li>
        <li><bold>The ability to provide and rate feedback on posts</bold> (we began designing a feature within the posting content flow for requesting feedback from other users, but it wasn't ready for full testing by week 8)</li>
        <li><bold>Favorites feature for collecting and grouping posts</bold> (we began designing and limited testing of this feature)</li>
        <li>Invite others to engage in posts of all types (rooms, petitions, larger deliverables); communicating updates to people</li>
        <li>Heavily collaborative features within the posts themselves</li>
        <li><bold>Personalized homepage for users</bold></li>
        <li>Live audio/video chat rooms (a holdover from the Phase 1 mobile app prototype)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Card Sorting and Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>Because the navigation of the existing site was inconsistent and confusing and because we had a wealth of features to organize into our information architecture, we ran a series of unmoderated card sorts on OptimalSort. Our whole team collaborated in writing the cards for our initial open sort. Next, we ran a closed sort based on the categories identified in the open sort. Finally, we ran a hybrid sort to clarify and validate our findings after noticing some bias in our wording of cards in the closed sort.</p>

        <p>With sitemap in hand, the design team got to the earnest work of creating a high-fidelity, clickable prototype that we could then test. The first user flow to be mapped and designed was the process for creating a post.</p>

          <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
<div class="row"> <!-- Begin container for two columns -->
  <div class="col-lg-9"> <!-- Begin column 1 -->
          <p>Amidst our struggle to recruit interview participants, we tried enticing current users with early access to our prototype. They didn’t bite. In the interest of time, we made the tough decision not to test the prototype with current TST users at all. Instead, we recruited representative users within the 13-22 age group who use social media and engage in creative pursuits.</p>
              <p>We ran 5 moderated remote usability tests with our representative users. I served as moderator for one usability test and as note-taker in another. We tested the posting flow for users to submit their content to the site and made 3 key improvements to that flow based on our findings:</p>
              <h3>1. Add media button</h3>
              <p>This was originally a “+” that when clicked expanded to show the different media types that could be uploaded. When users were asked to add a photo, they hard a hard time finding where to do that.</p>
              <p><bold>Solution:</bold> We replaced the “+” button with the icon buttons for each media type instead of hiding them under the original button.</p>

              <p>Test participants were confused by the purpose of the 3 icons at the bottom of a post. The envelope, speech bubble, and classic sharing icon seemed to participants to have potentially overlapping uses.</p>
              <p><bold>Solution:</bold> Because the MVP didn’t have a chat feature, the fastest solution was to remove the envelope icon which would have taken users to the not-yet-extant chat feature.</p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>This project moved on to Phase 3 with the understanding that our client was happy with the prototype created in Phase 2. She asked that we not start over again in Phase 3 and keep building out the platform. Our development team had already begun working based on what we had, but we needed to make our designs pixel perfect and conduct some additional research on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding the user: Phases 1 and 2 both ran out of time to flesh out proto personas into complete user personas, and this deliverable would go a long way towards focusing feature priorities for Phase 3.</li>
            <li>Collaboration: We conducted a brief survey that showed people of all ages collaborate, but we didn’t get a clear sense of whether target users engage in collaborative projects for fun, or if these are just a requirement of school and work. If collaboration is something the target user group engages in for fun, what projects are they working on and how do they do that work? Do they have any unmet needs in this realm?</li>
            <li>Notifications: Our team had conversations about whether and how to mitigate the stress of notifications, as well as how receiving notifications plays into the addictiveness of social media, but we ran out of time to conduct research on the topic that would allow our designers to address notifications in a way that would fit into the TST ethos.</li>
            <li>Anonymous posting: Our team debated at length whether anonymous posting should be allowed and what it would look like on the platform. Our client was very much pro pseudonyms on the platform for users to conceal their real identities. Her reasoning was that some would find it easier to post about sensitives topics under a pseudonym, but I and others on our team wondered whether anonymity would lead to the very toxic behavior TST hoped to keep out of its community. I drafted a survey but ultimately decided this would be a topic best tackled in user interviews, for which we had run out of time.</li>
            <li>Goal-setting: Our prototype included a goal-setting feature based on secondary research, but more research is needed on how the target user base feels about goal-setting and whether this is a feature they would find useful.</li>

              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
              <h3>Alignmnet</h3>
              <p>The balancing act between business needs and users’ goals and needs is the tension that makes UX research so interesting, but in this project, there was misalignment on that front that was never fully resolved. While the client had a clear vision for her product, it wasn’t clear that there were in fact users out there for whom this product would solve a real problem. Our lack of access to current TST users for research made it difficult to deliver a compelling case to our client about how best to deliver value with her product.</p>
              <h3>Focus</h3>
                <p>Our team was very eager and, in our excitement about the product, guilty of chasing shiny objects. We would have benefited from more clearly documenting our decisions, justifications, and ideas to be validated. Keeping specific and actionable documentation would have helped our team maintain focus on the project goal.</p>
                <h3>Over-commitment</h3>
                <p>This documentation also would have helped us avoid scope creep. We had a standard set by Phase 1 that our client would expect us to build a fairly complete prototype by the end of our 8 weeks and we strove to meet that standard. However, the loss of half of the design team over the course of the project should have led us to reassess our scope.</p>
                <p>Despite these challenges, our design team pulled off a small miracle with the high-fidelity prototype they produced and iterated on in the final weeks. We managed to give our client a clear picture of our solution to her user engagement problem, complete with some updating of TST’s brand identity.</p>
                <h3>Recruitment</h3>
                <p>Recruiting research participants within a short project timeline was a challenge. A few steps I would’ve implemented include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Announcing the project through TST's channels</li>
                  <li>Recruiting users on sites and platforms they already use, including TST's own website</li>
                  <li>Building credibility by leveraging client connections</li>
                  <li>Offering incentives to participants in the initial outreach effort</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The fact that any current users replied to our emails at all (and in the middle of summer no less) showed that TST users are not your average teenager, but we might have scared them off with the prospect of recording our conversations. When we tried to reschedule with our no-shows, they did not reply. We can’t know for sure, but it’s possible at least one of our would-be interview subjects was under 18 and would have needed a parent or guardian’s consent to participate.</p>
