            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
              I’m a UX Researcher with a background in English literature. I started my career as a storyteller. Working in PR for higher education, I researched to understand what set my clients’ stories apart from the competition. I immersed myself
              in the media landscape to know exactly what outlet and journalist would be receptive to the pitch. Then, I crafted a story pitch that would capture their attention. As exciting as it is to get someone on NPR, the results of a good PR
              campaign can be somewhat intangible. So I’m bringing my insatiable curiosity to the field of user experience design where I (and my users) can enjoy the tangible results of my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              When building a house, you wouldn’t skip the foundation. You certainly wouldn’t skip the frame — what would hold up the roof? Just like a sturdy house needs its foundation and frame, a usable design must be built upon user research.
              It’s my goal as a User Experience Researcher to build delightful experiences for users.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve been that frustrated user who wondered why an interface changed and why nobody asked me what I wanted. Now, I get to be the person who asks users what their needs and goals are. And it is so very rewarding when I can validate a
              design with target users during a usability study.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born in Bad Ischl, Austria and moved to Pennsylvania when I was 6 years old. Growing up feeling at home on two different continents has given me a perspective on our world that’s made me curious to always ask why and to
              interrogate the stories we tell about ourselves and our world. I channel that inquisitiveness and desire to make things better into my research and design work.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I’m not busy saving the world from poor design, I’m either reading or out in nature (possibly also reading). I love hiking, kayaking, and exploring our beautiful planet. If you happen to meet me on a video call, you’re sure to also
              meet one or both of my cats, Francis and Walter (our dog is camera shy).
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m always looking for opportunities to engage in creative problem solving. If you’ve got a job or freelance opportunity or would like to collaborate on a project, send me a message.
